        <p>Hey everyone, you can call me Nando. I enjoy photography as a hobby and I also love to longboard by the beach. These two activities keep me sane and help my quality of life overall.</p> 
        <p>I'm from Florida but let's just say I live in Mount Olympus. I love anime, video games, Marvel/DC and all things nerdy. </p>
        <p>I attended American InterContinental University for Game Design Development but due personal reasons at the time, I could not continue pursuing a career in that industry and currently work as Warehouse Manager and learning how to supervise/manage people. Turns out I have a knack for working with people, leading and hopefully be able to use these skills in future endeavors.</p>
        <p>Now I currently attend a bootcamp for Full Stack Development at UM and hoping to change careers soon. Putting forth maximum effort on this, I'm meant to be in a vocation that is much more technical and hopefully leave behind the days of working in hot warehouses.</p>
